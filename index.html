				<h2>Hobbiesüé®</h2>
					<p>As I've mentioned before, I have several hobbies and I have diverse range of interests that enrich my personal and social life. I enjoy running and trapeze, which not only keep me active but also challenge my physical limits. My curiosity drives me to read extensively and listen to podcasts on various topics, expanding my knowledge and perspectives. I also have a creative side, as I enjoy making jewelry, crafting bracelets and necklaces that reflect my personal style. Additionally, I engage in online commerce through Vinted and local flea markets, where I sell items I no longer need. Cooking has become a passion of mine over the past four years, allowing me to experiment with different cuisines and flavors. Lastly, I find fulfillment in giving back to the community through volunteering, particularly by donating clothing to those in need.</p>

				<h2>Passionsüëó</h2>
					<p> Since very young, my mother has always been into fashion, teaching me about brands, about styling and fashion history. I have always adored going shopping with her and in my teenage years I started to really take interest in the topic by watching fashion shows, reading Vogue and going to expositions related to fashion. I also love art, my parents are both creative people and I started going to drawing lessons as early as 5 years old! I continued in middle school and my artwrok got featured in the school journal. Finally in high school I took art as one of my spcialities until 11th grade. Finally, since my parents are both perfumers, I was also introduced to that world very early on. I now have an extensive collection of perfumes.</p>

				<h2>Projectsüë©üèª‚Äçüíº</h2>
					<p> In the future I'd like to become a project manager in the perfume creation sector or in the fashion sector. I also would like to either do a double diploma at McGill or a 6th month exchange in Canada at McGill. I also intend on joining during my second year the association called Conseil at my university. Fianlly, I plan on launching a small business of bracelets, a cooking website and an app to help students and proffessionals.</p>
